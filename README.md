detailed_related_work.xlsx: this file lists the detailed information of all the related work on the correlation between testing criteria and test-suite effectiveness. 

corre_kendalltau.xlsx: this file lists the kendall tau results of all our experiments. Note that as SPSS does not support the kendall tau results of partial correlation, so we do not calcuate the kendall taus for that.
